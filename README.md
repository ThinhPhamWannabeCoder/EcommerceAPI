# Ecommerce API

## Overview 👋

Welcome to the Ecommerce API project! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in Backend Development using [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/). It serves as the culmination of my term project for my Major in [Management Information System](https://daotao.neu.edu.vn/Resources/Docs/SubDomain/daotao/CTDT%20K63/27.%20Ngành%20Hệ%20thống%20thông%20tin%20quản%20lý_CTĐT%202021.pdf) at the [National Economics University](https://www.neu.edu.vn).

*After writing more and more I found out this sails JS is kinda "bad" if i want to be more flexible and use more third party package (I can only use Sails ecosystem which is really poor in resources). So this repo will be stopped written after I add a decent `product module` and `user-admin module` and I will went on NEST JS and use TypeScript*

## Project Goals 🎯

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Learn Backend Development with Sails.js:** The project is a hands-on exploration of Sails.js, a Node.js web framework. I am focusing on understanding and implementing backend solutions with Sails.js to build robust and scalable applications.

2. **Complete Term Project:** This project fulfills the academic requirements for my Management Information System major at the National Economics University.

## Project Structure 📂

## Database Design 👨‍🎨

Because this project is being developed concurrently with my term project for my major, a database structure will be included in this repository at a later stage in the development process.

## RESTful API Principles 🗿

This project strictly follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). The API endpoints are designed to be intuitive, consistent, and adhere to standard conventions to facilitate ease of use and integration.

## Getting Started 👨‍🏫

### 1. Clone the Repository

- `git clone git@github.com:ThinhPhamWannabeCoder/EcommerceAPI.git`

### 2. Install Dependencies

- `cd ecommerce`
- `npm install`

### 3. Run the Application

- `npm start`

*The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:1337`.* 📌

### 4. Explore API Endpoints 🚄

Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.
Navigate to `http://localhost:1337` and explore the available endpoints.

### 5. Documentation

The Documentation will be published in the near future, now, please go though `routes/` and `api/controllers`

You are now set up to explore and work with the Ecommerce API. Feel free to customize and extend the functionality based on your project requirements.
